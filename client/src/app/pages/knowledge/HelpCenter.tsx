    question: "How does the credit system work?",
    answer:
      "Every time you teach a skill, you earn credits. One hour of teaching equals 1 credit. You can then use these credits to learn from anyone else on the platform. It's a pure knowledge-for-knowledge exchange.",

    question: "What skills can I barter?",
    answer:
      "Anything from programming and data science to graphic design, languages, or even cooking and music. As long as someone is willing to learn it and you can teach it, it's valid.",
